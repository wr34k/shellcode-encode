# Shellcode encode

wip...

Very simple encoding but enough to bypass a mast majority of AVs out there.. Perfect for backdooring legit bins using codecaves for example

You can create your won encoding logic by first creating the decoder in asm, then doing the same logic to apply on the shellcode in python. You can also add multiple layer of encoding for no reason..
